# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Todo List App
A simple yet functional Todo List application built with React and Vite. This app allows users to manage their daily tasks with features for marking tasks as complete, deleting individual tasks, and clearing all tasks. Task data is stored in the browser's local storage, so tasks remain saved even if the page is reloaded.

Features
Add New Todos: Users can easily add new tasks to their todo list.
Mark as Completed: Tasks can be marked as complete, visually distinguishing completed tasks from pending ones.
Delete Individual Task: Users can delete specific tasks from the list.
Clear All Tasks: A single click option to remove all tasks from the list.
Persistent Data: Todos are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.
